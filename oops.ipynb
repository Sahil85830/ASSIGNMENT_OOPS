    "'''The five key concepts of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) are:\n",
    "\n",
    "    1.Class and Object:\n",
    "\n",
    "    A class is a blueprint or template for creating objects. It defines attributes (data) and methods (functions) that the objects will have.\n",
    "    An object is an instance of a class that encapsulates data and behavior defined by the class.'''\n",
    "#code -\n",
    "class Car:\n",
    "    def __init__(self, brand, model):\n",
    "        self.brand = brand\n",
    "        self.model = model\n",
    "\n",
    "my_car = Car(\"Toyota\", \"Corolla\")  # Object of class Car\n",
    "\n",
    "'''2.Encapsulation:\n",
    "\n",
    "    Encapsulation is the bundling of data (attributes) and methods (functions) together within a class, restricting direct access to some of the object's components.\n",
    "    Access control is provided using access modifiers like private (_) or protected (__).'''\n",
    "#code -\n",
    "class BankAccount:\n",
    "    def __init__(self, balance):\n",
    "        self.__balance = balance  # Private attribute\n",

    "    def get_balance(self):\n",
    "        return self.__balance\n",
    "\n",
    "'''3.Inheritance:\n",
    "\n",
    "    Inheritance allows a class (child class) to derive properties and behavior from another class (parent class), enabling code reuse and the creation of hierarchical relationships.'''\n",

    "        super().__init__(brand)\n",
    "        self.model = model\n",
    "\n",
    "'''4.Polymorphism:\n",
    "\n",
    "    Polymorphism allows objects of different classes to be treated as objects of a common superclass. It supports method overriding and overloading.\n",
    "    For example, different classes might have a speak() method, but they can behave differently depending on the class.'''\n",
    "#code -\n",

    "'''5.Abstraction:\n",

    "The Method Resolution Order (MRO) in Python is the order in which Python searches for a method or attribute in a hierarchy of classes during inheritance.\n",
